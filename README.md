# AL-Inventory-Web-Application

*Synopsis*
    In this project, I built a simple inventory management application for a single resource, a beginner-friendly client database. Through my application, you will be able to see a few clients, remove those clients, and create new clients. 


## Set-Up Instructions
    In order to run this app, you should open the following site https://anickacodes.github.io/AL-Inventory-Web-Application/ in your select browser

    You could also open the terminal in this repository and type `open index.html`
    After hitting `enter` , you will be taken to a live site


## On Load Features
You can see a title for the web application, a log-in field, a hyperlink and two separate boxes.

You can see each box has three unique inputs and a default;  
name
*occupation*
*active client*
*default image*

You can see a "Remove Client" button associated with each client.

You can see a form to create a new that includes all fields for each client, a "Submit" button, and a "Clear" button.

***Interactive Features***

When a user clicks on the "Remove" button for each client, that client is removed from the page.

If all required fields are not met, the inputs stay until the conditions are met or the form is cleared



*You cannot update "Active" status for old clients, only new ones*



***Stretch goals***

#If a field is missing a value, provide a default value when a resource is created on the page.
