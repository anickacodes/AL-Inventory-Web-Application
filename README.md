# AL-Inventory-Web-Application
Pre-End of Mod 2 Project

**ignore below**
In this project, you will build a simple inventory management application for a single resource. That resource could be shoes, books, snacks, or anything else you are interested in. Through your application, you will be able to visually display a few resources, remove those resources, and create new resources. This project will require heavy DOM manipulation in addition to a solid understanding of HTML and CSS.

##Project Scoring
This project has two different parts on which you will be graded. Each part is weighted differently.



##Completion

Your GitHub repository should have a README.md file with setup instructions and a guide on how to run your application.

***Styling***
The page should have a cohesive and professional style, that makes use of a few specific colors.

The page should make use of CSS Grid, and include at least two columns.

The page should have at least one responsive element on the page that changes depending on the screen's size.

***On Load Features***
Users can see a header on the top of the page that includes a title for the web application.

Users can see three unique resources, that include the following fields and at least two others:
name
price / occupation 
in stock / active client

Users can see a "Remove" button associated with each resource.

Users can see a form that includes all fields for each resource, a "Submit" button, and a "Reset" button.

***Interactive Features***

When a user clicks on the "Remove" button for each resource, that resource is removed from the page.

The user should have a way to update the "in stock" value for existing resources. 

An interaction should change the resource from being "in stock" to "out of stock," and vice versa.

The form should require at least three of the fields of the resource to be required. 
If the "Submit" button is clicked and those requirements are not met, an error message should be shown to the user telling them exactly what is wrong. 

The form fields should stay filled in and a resource should not be created.

When the "Reset" button is clicked, the form should be cleared.

When the form is completed correctly, the form should be cleared and a new resource should appear at the top of all previous resources.



***Stretch goals***
incorporate a feature, technology, or skill not explicitly required by the project instructions.

When you submit your pull request, make sure to include a description of any stretch goals you implemented. You may choose from the list below or come up with features or tasks that are more relevant to your specific implementation of the project.

#When a resource is clicked, the element is expanded and more information is displayed.

#If a field is missing a value, provide a default value when a resource is created on the page.

#Allow for the ability to edit existing resources, by using the already existing form.

#Incorporate complex CSS properties like transition effects.

#Create a Footer that sticks to the bottom of the browser window even if all elements have been removed.
