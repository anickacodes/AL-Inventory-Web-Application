🎉🎪events : 
    change, 
    click,
    submit,
    DOMContentLoaded,

 🤪😜things to add:
    -require 3 inputs when creating & handle that edgecase if not met( & keep inputs)
    -when you create the client, where do they go ?? make:
        the form clear
        new client return(👀) @ the top of new clients
    -do i need a count for the resources (clients) accumulate where: active v inactive ??
    -make the reset buttons say 'remove'
    -get reset buttons to remove client from list(s)
    -are you sure you want to remove client from page/database/list
    **make active resources add users to html in directory
    -fresh README
